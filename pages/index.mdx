# Gabriel Noya

Hey! I'm an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science undergrad at Stanford University, planning to graduate in June 2026.

My current interest is exploring the new software demands that will come with the new age of robotics.

I am currently thinking about solutions in orchestration, maitenance, and analytics of multiple robots. As well as tools for producing synthetic data / simulations / reinforcement learning environments for robot training.
My most recent job was at NVIDIA, where I worked on the Omniverse team, specifically in integrating Mujoco, NVIDIA omniverse and Gym with the goal of achieving high performance Visual RL.

Please reach out if any of these ideas sound interesting to you, and check out the other pages to learn more about me!
