# Gabriel Noya

Hey, I'm a Computer Engineering undergrad at Stanford University with a passion for solving
complex problems through technology.

My expertise lies in quickly learning new technologies and leading teams to deliver complex projects on time
and within budget. In the last few years, I have acquired skills in full-stack mobile development, systems programming
using C and C++, and embedded software development. As the CTO at Bux, my current position, I have successfully led a software development
team and deployed a large-scale banking app.

My current interest is exploring the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence;
I am actively looking for solutions that implement the newest cutting-edge models into digestible
consumer-oriented software. To this end, I have recently created Altiro, a chatbot platform that brings Chat-GPT technology to
South Americans, which now has over 100,000 users.
